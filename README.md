# CS50
All of my personal projects completed while taking the Harvard CS50 Online Course 

This is where I put my personal projects from CS50's free online course through their streams.
In the game section, I played around with LUA for the first time, and using the basic skeleton and assets given through CS50, created my own mario game with an infinite number of levels that are pseudo-randomely generated.
In the web section, I used Flask to create different websites, from a basic login-site, to a stock trading simulator, using the stucture of CS50 as well as adding my own personal touches and features to the website.
